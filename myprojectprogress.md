 I'd like to work on Submitty as my open source project. It is under a Github organization, where issues from the issues list are only assigned to those that are already members of the organization. Contributions can still be made by anyone outside the organization and merged by an admin. My plan is to work on improving CSV uploads for course management in the instructor UI.
